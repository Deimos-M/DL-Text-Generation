# Text Generation Using RNN
This repository explores how recurrent neural networks can be used to generate sequence data, in our case text data. I have implemented two technique to perform text generation using RNN, which are character level text generation and word level text generation. Char level text generation seems to be producing poor results than word level text generation,  but I have only trained both of these models for lesser epochs, you can always increase epochs to get better results.
